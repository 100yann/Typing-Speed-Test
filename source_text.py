    1:'The most beautiful humming birds are found in the West Indies and South America. '
      'The crest of the tiny head of one of these birds shines like a sparkling crown of colored light. '
      'The shades of color that adorn its breast are equally brilliant. As the bird flits from one flower to another, '
      'it looks more like a bright flash of sunlight than it does a living being. '
      'You ask, why are they called humming birds? It is because they make a soft, humming noise by the rapid motion '
      'of their wings—a motion so rapid, that as they fly, you can hardly see that they have wings. '
      'One day when walking in the woods, I found the nest of one of the smallest humming birds. '
      'It was about half the size of a very small hen’s egg, and it was attached to a twig no thicker than '
      'a steel knitting needle. It seemed to have been made of cotton fibers and was covered with the softest bits '
      'of leaf and bark. It had two eggs in it, and each was about as large as a small sugarplum. '
      'When you approach the spot where one of these birds has built its nest, you need to be careful. '
      'The mother bird will dart at you and try to peck you. Its sharp beak may hurt you. '
      'The poor little thing knows no other way of defending its young, and instinct teaches '
      'it that you might carry off its nest if you find it',
}
